For the most part in the .NET stack the C# compiler will provide the devloper with enough useful information when errors occur in the build step (unlike in untyped languages). However, a plethora of tools exist to keep our code tidy such as StyleCop, Sonar and ReSharper. As with most things in the .Net stack, Microsoft provides a lot of tooling out-the-box for things like testing. Tests can be created via the UI in the Visual Studio IDE. Again, several alternative frameworks exist such as NUnit and XUnit. Given that C# is a typed language, Visual Studio takes care of issuing commands via MSBuild to build your projects, I'm sure alternatives exist but most won't ever need one. There are a few CI/CD options when it comes to the .NET framework including Jenkins, Octopus Deploy and Microsoft's very own Azure DevOps platform. Whether to go self-hosted or cloud-based will largely depend on an the organisation's requirements. Outsourcing to the cloud with something like DevOps is very convenient, since backups and maintenance is taken care of. The trade-off for that however, is the cost involved. Self-hosting requires that someone in the team has enough experience with CI/CD to configure and maintain the DevOps server. Often big factors in making the decision for self-hosted vs. cloud-based are to do with cost, configurability and convenience.
